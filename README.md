## About Me

I am an AI & Machine Learning engineering student with hands-on experience in building end-to-end machine learning and NLP systems. I specialize in designing data pipelines, fine-tuning deep learning models, and applying modern NLP and large language models (LLMs) to real-world problems.

My interests include Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models, federated learning, and applied AI systems. I enjoy experimenting with models, evaluating performance, and building scalable and practical solutions.
